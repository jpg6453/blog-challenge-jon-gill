# LetsGetChecked front end challenge 

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 or higher

### Quick start

#### 1. Run `npm install`

This will install all dependencies (listed in `package.json`) necessary to get the project up and running.

#### 2. Run `npm run api`

`npm run api` will start [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) on `localhost:9000`.

> Note: On occasion you may find the port 9000 is already in use. You can change this in the package.json.

#### 3. Run `node app.js`

`node app.js` will launch chrome on `localhost:3000`.

### Form Validation

 - Server-side form validation was attempted but I encountered issues displaying the errors to the user whilst remaining on the **blog-detail page**. I feel very close to the answer!
